# Dev Curriculum

> Instant web curriculum generator for developers

## What is this?

**Dev Curriculum** is the fastest and simplest way to make a web curriculum for developers.

In few minutes you can have your own **Web Curriculum** for free using **Dev Curriculum** and **Github Pages**.

#### What is a web curriculum?

It's the reduced version of a **Curriculum Vitae**, but made as a web page.

## Who this is made for?

Any developer that doesn't have a **Web Curriculum**.

## How it will look like?

I ain't just developed **Dev Curriculum**, I'm also using it as my own Web Curriculum and you can check a demo **[here](http://wendelladriel.github.io)**.

## How to use

#### Step 1 - Fork Dev Curriculum to your User Repository

Fork this repository, then rename the repository to `yourgithubusername.github.io`. Example: `wendelladriel.github.io`.

At this moment the **Web Curriculum** will often be viewable immediately at http://yourgithubusername.github.io.

#### Step 2 - Customize your Web Curriculum

To customize your **Web Curriculum** you will change only two files:
- `_config.yml`: in this file you have to put your personal informations and skills list
- `css/_variables.sass`: in this file you can change the colors to customize the appearance of your **Web Curriculum**

#### Step 3 - Publish your Web Curriculum

After you made the changes, just `commit` and `push` to your repository and your **Web Curriculum** is ready, just go to http://yourgithubusername.github.io and see your new awesome **Web Curriculum**!!!
